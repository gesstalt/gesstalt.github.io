            MIST: An Interactive Medical Image Segmentation Framework Using Iterative Refinement
        </strong>
        <br><br>
        Abstract:  <i>In order to obtain the most suitable method for medical image segmentation, we propose a two stage algorithm. 
        The ﬁrst stage automatically generates a binary marker image of the region of interest using mathematical morphology. 
        This marker serves as the mask image for the second stage which uses GrabCut on the input image thus resulting in an 
        eﬃcient segmented result. The obtained result can be further reﬁned by user interaction which can be done using the 
        Graphical User Interface (GUI). Experimental results show that the proposed method is accurate and provides satisfactory 
        segmentation results with minimum user interaction on medical as well as natural images.</i>

            Interactive 3D Visualization of Medical Image Data
        </strong>
        <br><br>
        Abstract:  <i>The baseline 3D visualization techniques focus on making more realistic rendering of the 3D scene at the cost of 
            approximation of the scene which could be critical in the medical domain. Also, there is no provision for user interaction to 
            perform modifications in the visualization model as per the needs. This is required by doctors for studying different parts of 
            the body through the same data. Interactive visualization of medical volume data requires ”realtime rendering” of the 
            scalar data under consideration with "high rendering quality". These two properties are complementary and thus an efficient 
            technique needs to be devised as per the application. Having coupled with the ideas from Computer Graphics to efficiently tackle 
            this problem, the key features of the developed software are:
            <ul>
                <li> User interaction to perform modifications in the model
                <li> Analysis of both tissues and bones can be done through a single volume data
                <li> Real time rendering with high rendering quality
            </ul>
