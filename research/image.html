            Floor plan analysis and retrieval
        </strong>
        <br><br>
        Abstract:  <i>Architects use existing projects as reference while designing. This process aids in providing insight on how similar architectural 
            situations were solved in the past. To search for similar projects, manual look-up through the layouts can be a cumbersome process. 
            A fast automatic electronic technique for understanding and retrieval of similar projects need to be adopted. </i>

            PIXIPHER: A Chaotic Maps and DNA Coding Based RGB Image Encryption and Decryption Framework
        </strong>
        <br><br>
        Abstract:  <i> Pixipher is a open source client-server architecture based framework. Given an RGB image we individually process 
            the three image channels and combine the encrypted channels to obtain the ﬁnal result. A sequence of chaotic sequence and DNA 
            encoding techniques are used in Pixipher to generate the ﬁnal encrypted image. The encrypted image can then be send to the desired
             receiver over the network using Pixipher, which uses SHA-160 technique for the point-to-point communication. At the receiver end 
             the decoding technique is just the complement of that of the encoding technique. Runtime analysis revealed that Pixipher’s execution time is 
             signiﬁcantly less as compared to other methods.

            Automatic Feature Weight Determination for Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)
        </strong>
        <br><br>
        Abstract:  <i> Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is one of the most active research area in multimedia information retrieval. Given a query
image the task is to search relevant images in a repository. Low level feature like color, texture and shape feature vectors of an image
are always considered to be an important attribute in CBIR system. Thus the performance of the CBIR system can be enhanced by com-
bining these feature vectors. In this paper we propose a novel CBIR framework by applying indexing using multiclass SVM and nding
the appropriate weights of the individual features automatically using the relevance ratio and mean dierence. We have taken the four
feature descriptors to represent color, texture and shape features. During retrieval, feature vectors of query image are combined, weighted
and compared with feature vectors of images in the database to rank order the results. Experiments were performed on four benchmark
datasets and performance is compared with existing techniques to validate our proposed framework.
